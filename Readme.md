This exporter translates from MQTT topics to prometheus metrics. The core design is that clients send arbitrary JSON messages
on the topics. The translation between the MQTT representation and prometheus metrics is configured in the mqtt2prometheus exporter since we often can not change the IoT devices sending 
the messages. Clients can push metrics via MQTT to an MQTT Broker. This exporter subscribes to the broker and
expose the received messages as prometheus metrics. Currently, the exporter supports only MQTT 3.1.

I wrote this exporter to expose metrics from small embedded sensors based on the NodeMCU to prometheus.
The used arduino sketch can be found in the [dht22tomqtt](https://github.com/hikhvar/dht22tomqtt) repository. 
A local hacking environment with mqtt2prometheus, a MQTT broker and a prometheus server is in the [hack](https://github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus/tree/master/hack) directory.

## Assumptions about Messages and Topics
This exporter makes some assumptions about the MQTT topics. This exporter assumes that each
client publish the metrics into a dedicated topic. The regular expression in the configuration field `mqtt.device_id_regex`
defines how to extract the device ID from the MQTT topic. This allows an arbitrary place of the device ID in the mqtt topic.
For example the [tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota) firmware pushes the telemetry data to the topics `tele/<deviceid>/SENSOR`.

Let us assume the default configuration from [configuration file](#config-file). A sensor publishes the following message
```json
{"temperature":23.20,"humidity":51.60, "computed": {"heat_index":22.92} }
```

to the MQTT topic `devices/home/livingroom`. This message becomes the following prometheus metrics:

```text
temperature{sensor="livingroom",topic="devices/home/livingroom"} 23.2
heat_index{sensor="livingroom",topic="devices/home/livingroom"} 22.92
humidity{sensor="livingroom",topic="devices/home/livingroom"} 51.6
```

The label `sensor` is extracted with the default `device_id_regex` `(.*/)?(?P<deviceid>.*)` from the MQTT topic `devices/home/livingroom`.
The `device_id_regex` is able to extract exactly one label from the topic path. It extracts only the `deviceid` regex capture group into the `sensor` prometheus label.
To extract more labels from the topic path, have a look at [this FAQ answer](#extract-more-labels-from-the-topic-path).

The topic path can contain multiple wildcards. MQTT has two wildcards: 
* `+`: Single level of hierarchy in the topic path
* `#`: Many levels of hierarchy in the topic path

This [page](https://mosquitto.org/man/mqtt-7.html) explains the wildcard in depth.

For example the `topic_path: devices/+/sensors/#` will match:
* `devices/home/sensors/foo/bar`
* `devices/workshop/sensors/temperature`

### JSON Separator
The exporter interprets `mqtt_name` as [gojsonq](https://github.com/thedevsaddam/gojsonq) paths. Those paths will be used
to find the value in the JSON message.
For example `mqtt_name: computed.heat_index`
addresses
```json
{
  "computed": {
    "heat_index":22.92
  }
}
```
Some sensors might use a `.` in the JSON keys. Therefore, there the configuration option `json_parsing.seperator` in 
the exporter config. This allows us to use any other string to separate hierarchies in the gojsonq path.
E.g let's assume the following MQTT JSON message:
```json
{
  "computed": {
    "heat.index":22.92
  }
}
```
We can now set `json_parsing.seperator` to `/`. This allows us to specify `mqtt_name` as `computed/heat.index`. Keep in mind, 
`json_parsing.seperator` is a global setting. This affects all `mqtt_name` fields in your configuration.

Some devices like Shelly Plus H&T publish one metric per-topic in a JSON format:
```
shellies/shellyplusht-xxx/status/humidity:0 {"id": 0,"rh":51.9}
```
You can use PayloadField to extract the desired value.

### Tasmota
An example configuration for the tasmota based Gosund SP111 device is given in [examples/gosund_sp111.yaml](examples/gosund_sp111.yaml).

## Build

To build the exporter run:

```bash
make build
```

Only the latest two Go major versions are tested and supported. 

### Docker

#### Use Public Image

To start the public available image run:
```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml"  -p  9641:9641 ghcr.io/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus:latest 
```
Please have a look at the [latest relase](https://github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus/releases/latest) to get a stable image tag. The latest tag may break at any moment in time since latest is pushed into the registries on every git commit in the master branch. 

#### Build The Image locally
To build a docker Image for your target system you can use the Dockerfile you need. After cloning the repository:
```bash
docker build -t mqtt2prometheus:arm -f Armv8Dockerfile .
```
To build a docker container with the mqtt2prometheus exporter included run:

```bash
make container
```

To run the container with a given config file:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml"  -p 9641:9641 mqtt2prometheus:latest 
```
To run the mqtt2prometheus with another port 

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml" -e PORT=9990 -p 9990:9990 mqtt2prometheus:latest 
```

## Configuration
The exporter can be configured via command line and config file. 

### Commandline
Available command line flags:

```text
Usage of ./mqtt2prometheus:
  -config string
        config file (default "config.yaml")
  -listen-address string
        listen address for HTTP server used to expose metrics (default "0.0.0.0")
  -listen-port string
        HTTP port used to expose metrics (default "9641")
  -log-format string
        set the desired log output format. Valid values are 'console' and 'json' (default "console")
  -log-level value
        sets the default loglevel (default: "info")
  -version
        show the builds version, date and commit
  -web-config-file string
        [EXPERIMENTAL] Path to configuration file that can enable TLS or authentication for metric scraping.
  -treat-mqtt-password-as-file-name bool (default: false)
        treat MQTT2PROM_MQTT_PASSWORD environment variable as a secret file path e.g. /var/run/secrets/mqtt-credential. Useful when docker secret or external credential management agents handle the secret file. 
```
The logging is implemented via [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap). The logs are printed to `stderr` and valid log levels are
those supported by zap.  


### Config file

   force_monotonicy: true
  
```

### Environment Variables

Having the MQTT login details in the config file runs the risk of publishing them to a version control system. To avoid this, you can supply these parameters via environment variables. MQTT2Prometheus will look for `MQTT2PROM_MQTT_USER` and `MQTT2PROM_MQTT_PASSWORD` in the local environment and load them on startup.
Also we can change the main port of MQTT2Prometheus
by using `PORT` environment.

#### Example use with Docker

Create a file to store your login details, for example at `~/secrets/mqtt2prom`:
```SHELL
#!/bin/bash
export MQTT2PROM_MQTT_USER="myUser" 
export MQTT2PROM_MQTT_PASSWORD="superpassword"
```

Then load that file into the environment before starting the container:
```SHELL
 source ~/secrets/mqtt2prom && \
  docker run -it \
  -e MQTT2PROM_MQTT_USER \
  -e MQTT2PROM_MQTT_PASSWORD \
  -e PORT=9990  \
  -v "$(pwd)/examples/config.yaml:/config.yaml" \
  -p 9641:9641 \
  ghcr.io/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus:latest
```

#### Example use with Docker secret (in swarm)

Create a docker secret to store the password(`mqtt-credential` in the example below), and pass the optional `treat-mqtt-password-as-file-name` command line argument.
```docker
  mqtt_exporter_tasmota:
    image: ghcr.io/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus:latest 
    secrets:
      - mqtt-credential 
    environment:
      - MQTT2PROM_MQTT_USER=mqtt
      - MQTT2PROM_MQTT_PASSWORD=/var/run/secrets/mqtt-credential
    entrypoint:
      - /mqtt2prometheus
      - -log-level=debug
      - -treat-mqtt-password-as-file-name=true
    volumes:
        - config-tasmota.yml:/config.yaml:ro
```



## Frequently Asked Questions

### Listen to multiple Topic Pathes
The exporter can only listen to one topic_path per instance. If you have to listen to two different topic_paths it is 
recommended to run two instances of the mqtt2prometheus exporter. You can run both on the same host or if you run in Kubernetes,
even in the same pod.

### Extract more Labels from the Topic Path
A regular use case is, that user want to extract more labels from the topic path. E.g. they have sensors not only in their `home` but also
in their `workshop` and they encode the location in the topic path. E.g. a sensor pushes the message

```json
{"temperature":3.0,"humidity":34.60, "computed": {"heat_index":15.92} }
```

to the topic `devices/workshop/storage`, this will produce the prometheus metrics with the default configuration.

```text
temperature{sensor="storage",topic="devices/workshop/storage"} 3.0
heat_index{sensor="storage",topic="devices/workshop/storage"} 15.92
humidity{sensor="storage",topic="devices/workshop/storage"} 34.60
```

The following prometheus [relabel_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config) will extract the location from the topic path as well and attaches the `location` label. 
```yaml
relabel_config:
  - source_labels: [ "topic" ]
    target_label: location
    regex: '/devices/(.*)/.*'
    action: replace
    replacement: "$1"
```

With this config added to your prometheus scrape config you will get the following metrics in prometheus storage:

```text
temperature{sensor="storage", location="workshop", topic="devices/workshop/storage"} 3.0
heat_index{sensor="storage", location="workshop", topic="devices/workshop/storage"} 15.92
humidity{sensor="storage", location="workshop", topic="devices/workshop/storage"} 34.60
```
