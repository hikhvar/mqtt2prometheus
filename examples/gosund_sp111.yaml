  # Optional: Username and Password for authenticating with the MQTT Server
  # user: bob

  # The Topic path to subscripe to. Actually this will become `$topic_path/+`
  topic_path: tele/+/SENSOR
  # Optional: Regular expression to extract the device ID from the topic path. The default regular expression, assumes
  # that the last "element" of the topic_path is the device id.
  # The regular expression must contain a named capture group with the name deviceid
  # For example the expression for tasamota based sensors is "tele/(?P<deviceid>.*)/.*"
  device_id_regex: "tele/(?P<deviceid>.*)/SENSOR"
  # The MQTT QoS level

# This is a list of valid metrics. Only metrics listed here will be exported
